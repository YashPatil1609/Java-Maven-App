# Java Maven CI/CD Application 🚀 (Main Branch)

This repository contains a **Java Maven application**, designed to demonstrate an end-to-end CI/CD pipeline using **Jenkins** and advanced Jenkins features like **pipeline jobs**, **external Groovy scripts**, and **Jenkins shared libraries**.

---

## ✨ Application Description
A simple Java Maven-based application, used as a learning project to showcase real-world CI/CD practices.

---

## 🛠️ CI/CD Pipeline Features

The pipeline in this branch demonstrates:

### 1. Jenkins Pipeline Jobs
- **Pipeline as Code** using a `Jenkinsfile` written in Groovy.
- Defines all build, test, and deployment stages inside the pipeline.

### 2. External Groovy Scripts
- Reusable helper scripts written in Groovy stored outside the `Jenkinsfile`.
- Promotes modularity and cleaner pipeline files.

### 3. Jenkins Shared Library
- Shared logic like common steps, utilities, and configurations are separated into a **shared library**.
- This library can be reused across multiple pipelines, ensuring DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principles.

## 🌟 Why This Setup Matters

- Makes the Jenkins pipelines **scalable**, **clean**, and **maintainable**.
- Encourages **best DevOps practices** for managing Jenkins projects.
- Demonstrates **real-world** industry patterns for CI/CD systems.
